# Changelog

This file records notable product and contributor-facing changes. Internal
implementation logs and physical evidence are maintained separately and are
not copied here.

The npm broker package and downloadable Flutter clients are separate release
channels. They can share a product version, but each channel retains its own
publication and acceptance controls. Artifact-specific notes and downloads are
available from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/cosyncing/cosyncing/releases).

## Unreleased

### Added

- A provisional, default-off DeepSeek Harness source adapter can connect to an
  operator-started `dsh web` host for session discovery, history, and shared
  foreground control.

### Fixed

- Codex 0.147 completed user-message records now appear in transcripts without
  duplicating legacy user-message records.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-08-14

### Changed

- Codex and Pi clients can join the broker's current Drive owner from another
  client without starting a second native Resume.
- Session ownership is tracked independently from each connection's mutation
  authority. Owner revisions reject stale joins and concurrent handoffs.
- Setup, repair, doctor, and uninstall now share one receipt-based Pi bridge
  ownership decision. A stale bridge updates automatically only when its
  receipt and current contents prove that cosyncing owns it; user edits and
  unsafe targets remain protected.
- The source tree is organized by broker domain, adapter package, and client
  capability, with provider-neutral adapter and session boundaries.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-08-12

### Added

- A unified Servers screen combines saved servers, direct connection, pairing,
  health, and recovery actions.
- File artifacts are isolated by server and native session and provide a
  bounded, authenticated download action.

### Changed

- Session tabs retain recent pages for faster switching. Roster status,
  activity time, transcript messages, and Observe/Drive controls are clearer.

### Fixed

- Refused Codex takeovers remain read-only and explain why control was denied.
- Accepted Codex renames propagate across the roster, header, tabs, refresh,
  and restart.
- Windows speech ownership and responsive-layout transitions no longer trigger
  the native crash found during initial client acceptance.
- OpenCode startup, Pi chronology and runtime readiness, large Codex sessions,
  and broker setup and recovery received reliability corrections.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-08-10

### Added

- Initial public self-hosted broker and packaged web client, distributed as a
  JavaScript npm package that runs with Bun.
- Session discovery, transcripts, prompts, and agent-specific Observe/Drive
  control for Codex, Claude Code, OpenCode, and Pi.
- Device pairing and private-network access for browser and installed clients.
- Initial Android, Linux, Apple Silicon macOS, and Windows Flutter client
  downloads.
